# first-flutter

This is my first Flutter Mobile App.

To build the app <code> flutter build apk --release</code>

Note: Before building apk, check your java version is compatible with the project. I used 8.3, Its compatible Java Version is 20.

If you want a preview before building the apk. Check the repository for builded APK.
